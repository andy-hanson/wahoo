# Wahoo

This was a game engine I made during college.


## Building

Install SBT: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html
Then: `sbt run`

It should download the appropriate versions of sbt, scalac, and lwjgl.


## Playing the demo game, Simon

Press Enter to start playing.
Press the arrow keys to match what Simon shows you.
Then press them again from memory.
The red box will count down your time.

Mess up even once and it's all over!
